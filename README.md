### Welcome to my GitHub profile

- I'm currently not directly working in the tech environment, I am working as manager in the coaches team of a tech department. 
- I'm currently increasing my professional coaching experience by doing a business coach education.
- I'm using GitHub to work on my own webpage. Furthermore it keeps some older repositories and some private projects.
